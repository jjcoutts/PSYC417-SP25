## Data types

-   Numeric - Whole numbers and integers

-   Integer - Whole numbers only, more efficient than numeric

-   Character (aka string) - Text data

-   Logical (aka Boolean) - TRUE/FALSE, usually in an evaluation of a statement

-   Factor - Ordered categorical data

You can check the data type if you're unsure using class

```{r}
num1 <- 1; class(num1);
num2 <- 5.62234; class(num2)
int <- 4L; class(int)
char1 <- "A"; class(char1)
char2 <- "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."; class(char2)
boo1 <- TRUE; class(boo1)
boo2 <- 3==3; class(boo2)
fact <- factor(c("Assistant","Associate","Full"),levels=c("Assistant","Associate","Full"));class(year)
```

Try fixing these data types below

```{r}
# I want the below to be logical
boohoo = "false"

# I want the below to be numeric
intish = 4.6L

# I wawnt the below to be an ordered factor with the levels first, second, third, last. For some reason it's in alphabetical order!
facty = factor(c("First","Second","Third","Last"))

# I want the below to be a numeric
numy = "8"

# I want the below to be character
chard = chard

print(exp(710)) >= print(10^309)
```

## Practice exercises

Create a different chunk for each of these practice exercises (for practice).

1.  Create an object called "four" with the value 3 and an object "three" with the value 4 and check whether three \> four and three == 4.
2.  Check whether your two favorite Ryans in Hollywood are equal (e.g., "Ryan Reynolds" == "Ryan Gosling"). What about their first names?
3.  Create a variable called X and assign it a value of 10. Then, on the same line, check if the square root of X is greater than the log of X.
4.  Create a variable called Y and assign it to a value of 709. ON the next line, create a variable called Z and assign it a value of 308. Check whether the exponential of Y is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of Z.
5.  Copy the code from the problem above and increase Y and Z by 1. What changed (besides the numbers being 710 and 309)?
6.  Print both Y and Z. What are they equal to?
7.  Create a formula that calculates your grade in a class based on three categories: Exams as 50% of your grade, Homework as 25%, and Attendance as 25%. Create three variables called exam_avg, hw_avg, and attend, and assign them values of your choice. Make sure the grades make sense!

**That's all for now. Thank you for a great first class! :)**
