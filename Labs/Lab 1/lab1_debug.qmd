## War on bugs

From: confused_professor

To: programming_expert

Please help me with the below code. I need to submit this paper ASAP but I'm just starting to learn R and don't know exactly what to do. I appreciate it.

Best,\
CP

```{r}
bool = true
priNt(bool)
bool = booI + 1
```

```{r}
bool*45LL
CLASS(BOOL)
trueish = Log(45) truish== log(45)
```

```{r}
Nums1 = seq(trueish:5).

Nums2<-SEQ(5:truefish)
```

```{r}
plt <-- plot(X;y); 

print the plot below this is a comment
print('The plot above is a scatterplot")
```

Do not delete any of the lines above, just fix them so the document runs. Knit and submit on ELMS!
